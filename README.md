# caesar_cipher
The original encryption technique, used by Caesar himself, in Python. This is a mono-alphabetic substitution cipher where each letter of the plain text is shifted a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

>If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If >anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others.

— Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar 56
